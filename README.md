# 🛡️ Plithos — AI-Based Crowd Safety Monitoring System

## 📌 Project Overview
Plithos is an AI-powered crowd safety monitoring system designed to detect abnormal or unsafe behavior in public environments using surveillance cameras, YOLO computer vision models, and cloud infrastructure.

The system helps security teams improve monitoring efficiency by automatically detecting incidents such as fights, littering, and suspicious crowd behavior while generating real-time alerts.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Public environments such as malls, schools, hotels, and event venues rely heavily on manual monitoring systems. These systems may fail to detect dangerous or inappropriate behavior quickly. Plithos provides an automated AI-based monitoring solution that detects abnormal activities in real time and supports faster decision-making for security teams.
